#  NGSTools : Next-Generation sequencing toolkits

Author: Czh3 <zhangchao3@hotmail.com>

High-throughput sequencing technology is repaidly becoming the standrd method for genomics, transcriptomic and epigenetics. The down stream data analysis is sophisticated because of the unprecedented data throughput. This NGSTools helps you to do this by writing a few line of scripts.

For illumina sequencing platform:
* Hiseq 2000
* Hiseq 2500
* HiseqX-Ten/Five
* Hiseq 3000
* Hiseq 4000
* Miseq

Based on:
* python::Bio
* fastqc
* fastx
* cutadapt
* SAMtools
* picard
* GATK
* HTseq
* cufflinks
* DEseq2


This Frame help you to build your own pipeline easily.

Here is a example of RNA-sequencing pipeline.
